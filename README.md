# Paralus

Paralus is a free, open source tool that enables controlled, audited access to Kubernetes infrastructure. It comes with just-in-time service account creation and user-level credential management that integrates with your RBAC and SSO. Ships as a GUI, API, and CLI.

It eliminates the burden of having to configure and manage Kubernetes Role Based Access Control cluster by cluster. Streamline and consolidate access control for your fleet of clusters spanning different operating environments, different clouds (EKS, AKS, etc.), and on-premises data centers operating behind firewalls. A single login gives authorized users (e.g., developers, operations, contractors, etc.) seamless and secure access to all clusters with a native and familiar `kubectl` experience.
